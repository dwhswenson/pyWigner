# pyWigner
Python toolkit for LSC-IVR (classical Wigner) simulations, built on
[OpenPathSampling](http://www.openpathsampling.org)

The linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR, also
sometimes called the "classical Wigner" method) is an approach to include
some quantum effects into classical molecular dynamics simulations.

pyWigner is a tool designed both to run LSC-IVR simulations and to develop
new approaches based on the LSC-IVR.
