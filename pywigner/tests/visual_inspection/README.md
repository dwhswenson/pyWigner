# Visual inspection tests

These are tests for stochastic problems, where the cost of getting
sufficient statistics to get statistically certain answer is prohibitive for
daily testing. However, we *can* run some basic tests and compare them to
expected results. That's what we do here.

These tests are IPython notebooks. Correctness requires visual inspection,
although they can be run by automation.
